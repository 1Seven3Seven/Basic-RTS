# Basic-RTS
The name inspiration from GitHub is "fluffy-fiesta" and I just love that name, but alas, it is not meant to be.

## Ideas
- Grid based
- Have a main base to protect
- Place spawners that gradually generate entities that move to the enemy base
- Can place walls that can be destroyed
  - Pathfinding may ignore walls but give them a higher weight
  - If pathing goes through walls then entities may destroy them
- Workers that are the building force
  - Spawned from worker spawners when work is queued
- Max number of workers from worker spawners
  - There is no max for entities
- Have trees that can be cut down by workers
  - Gives wood to produce basic buildings
    - Walls
    - Basic spawners
    - mines
- Stone deposits to mine stone from
  - Can be used for better buildings
